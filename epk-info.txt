Keep the biography short. Your biography should include where you are based and a brief sketch about your professional work. For musicians or bands, also include all band members and instruments that are played. Please do not make this long and do not bore your reader with details of your struggle or other irrelevant details.

Provide links to your professional work: Links to your professional videos and audios or professional images for models, photographers, painters. Make sure that all links are working and are of good quality.

Add professional pictures. Especially applicable to those who are rock bands or actor or models. Try to get a professional to shoot you and include 2-3 pictures in your EPK.

Include a few quotes from other professionals in your field that have something positive to say about your work. Do not make the mistake of providing quotes from friends or family. If you are just starting out then try to get quotes from your teachers or professors.

Include links to your press coverage (if any).

Add any gig/tour/show information: Mention any past or upcoming gigs/tours or shows (paintings/photographers).
